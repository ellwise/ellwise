### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a data scientist improving asset management within infrastructure engineering projects.**

Most of my professional work is done using **Python**, with **Plotly Dash** for web-app development and recently **Simpy** for discrete-event simulation.
That said, I've also contributed to web-apps directly in **Javascript (React Boostrap)**, and can stand-up basic **cloud infrastructure** for deployment.
I have a background as a researcher in numerical analysis, and so it should come as no surprise that I'm also a big fan of **Julia** which I use in hobby projects.
Professionally, I'm currently focussing on techno-economic modelling: lifecycle simulation of large engineering infrastructure for feasibility studies and optioneering.

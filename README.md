### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a data scientist working on asset management and infrastructure engineering projects.**

Most of my professional work is done using **Python**, and I've recently been making use of **Plotly Dash** for web-app development.
That said, I've also contributed to web-apps directly in **Javascript (React Boostrap)**, and I'm able to **dockerise and deploy** small projects.
I have a background as a researcher in numerical analysis, and so it should come as no surprise that I'm also a big fan of **Julia** which I use in hobby projects.
